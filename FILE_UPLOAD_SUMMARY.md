1. **Storage Configuration**
   - ✅ Private bucket: `user-files`
   - ✅ User-specific folders: `/user-{id}/`
   - ✅ File size limit: 50MB
   - ✅ Supported MIME types configured

2. **Database Schema** (`file_uploads` table)
   - ✅ User association (`user_id`)
   - ✅ File metadata storage
   - ✅ Processing status tracking
   - ✅ Upload timestamps
   - ✅ File path references

3. **Security & Access Control**
   - ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - ✅ User-specific file access
   - ✅ Authenticated uploads only
   - ✅ Secure file paths with UUIDs

---

## 🔧 Setup & Configuration

### ✅ Migration Files
- ✅ `20250616061104_file_upload_setup.sql` - Storage bucket and RLS policies

### ✅ Setup Scripts
- ✅ `setup-file-upload.sh` - Automated setup script
- ✅ Comprehensive manual setup instructions

### ✅ Documentation
- ✅ `FILE_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md` - Complete implementation guide
- ✅ `FILE_UPLOAD_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

---

## 🧪 Testing

### ✅ Test Files Created
- ✅ `FileUpload.test.tsx` - Comprehensive component tests
- ✅ `FileList.test.tsx` - File management tests
- ✅ Mock implementations for Supabase and AuthContext

### ✅ Test Coverage
- ✅ File upload functionality
- ✅ File validation (type, size)
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ User authentication
- ✅ File management operations
- ✅ UI interactions

---

## 🔒 Security Features

### ✅ Implemented Security Measures

1. **Authentication Required**
   - ✅ All file operations require user authentication
   - ✅ Unauthenticated users cannot upload or access files

2. **User Isolation**
   - ✅ Files stored in user-specific folders: `/user-{id}/`
   - ✅ RLS policies ensure users can only access their own files
   - ✅ Database queries filter by `user_id`

3. **File Validation**
   - ✅ File type validation (whitelist approach)
   - ✅ File size limits (50MB per file)
   - ✅ MIME type checking

4. **Secure Storage**
   - ✅ Private bucket (not public)
   - ✅ Authenticated access only
   - ✅ Secure file paths with UUIDs
