- **Readiness Probes**: `/health/ready` for deployment validation
- **Liveness Probes**: `/health/live` for basic service availability
- **Detailed Metrics**: Response times, service status, error tracking
- **Kubernetes Compatible**: Standard health check endpoints

### âœ… 3. Zero-Downtime Deployment

**Files Created:**
- `project/scripts/deploy.sh` - Zero-downtime deployment script
- `project/.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - CI/CD pipeline

**Deployment Features:**
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime production deployments
- **Health Monitoring**: Automatic rollback on health check failures
- **Backup & Recovery**: Automatic backup before deployment
- **Smoke Testing**: Post-deployment verification
- **Notifications**: Slack/Discord integration for deployment status

### âœ… 4. CI/CD Pipeline

**GitHub Actions Workflow:**
- **Automated Testing**: Lint, test, coverage reporting
- **Security Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability scanning
- **Multi-Environment**: Staging and production deployments
- **Performance Testing**: Automated performance validation
- **Artifact Management**: Docker image versioning and tagging

### âœ… 5. Production Monitoring

**Monitoring Stack:**
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and alerting
- **Health Checks**: Service availability monitoring
- **Logging**: Centralized log management
- **Performance**: Response time and throughput monitoring
