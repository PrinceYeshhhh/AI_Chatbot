# Cloudinary Migration Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the migration from Firebase Storage to Cloudinary for file storage in the Smart Brain AI Chatbot application.

## Changes Made

### ✅ Backend Changes

1. **New Cloudinary Service** (`project/server/src/services/cloudinaryStorageService.ts`)
   - Complete file upload, download, and management functionality
   - Support for all file types (documents, images, audio)
   - Automatic file categorization and metadata storage
   - Secure URL generation and file transformations

2. **Updated Upload Routes** (`project/server/src/routes/upload.ts`)
   - Modified to use Cloudinary instead of local storage
   - Files are uploaded to Cloudinary and then processed
   - Temporary files are cleaned up after processing
   - Enhanced error handling for cloud storage operations

3. **Configuration Updates** (`project/server/src/config/index.ts`)
   - Replaced Firebase configuration with Cloudinary settings
   - Updated environment variable validation

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Updated `project/server/env.example`
   - Updated `project/client/env.example`
   - Replaced Firebase variables with Cloudinary credentials

5. **Dependencies** (`project/server/package.json`)
   - Added `cloudinary: ^2.0.1`
   - Added `@types/cloudinary: ^1.0.0`

### ✅ Features Implemented

1. **File Upload to Cloudinary**
   - Automatic upload of all file types to Cloudinary
   - User-specific folder structure: `users/{userId}/files/`
   - Metadata preservation (original filename, upload date, user ID)
   - Support for documents, images, and audio files

2. **File Management**
   - File deletion from Cloudinary
   - File listing by user
   - Metadata retrieval and updates
   - Secure URL generation

3. **Processing Pipeline**
   - Files uploaded to Cloudinary first
   - Then processed for text extraction and embedding
   - Temporary local files cleaned up after processing
   - Error handling for both upload and processing failures

4. **Multi-Modal Support**
   - Images: JPG, JPEG, PNG, WebP, HEIC, HEIF
   - Audio: MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC, OGG, WebM
   - Documents: PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, XLS, XLSX

## Environment Variables

### Required Cloudinary Variables

```env
# Backend (.env)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

# Frontend (.env)
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
```

### Removed Firebase Variables

```env
# These are no longer needed:
FIREBASE_API_KEY
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
FIREBASE_APP_ID
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL
# ... and other Firebase-related variables
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Cloudinary Account

1. Go to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and create an account
2. Get your Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret from the dashboard
3. Configure your upload presets if needed

### 2. Update Environment Variables

1. **Backend**: Update your server `.env` file with Cloudinary credentials

# In the server directory
cd project/server
npm install cloudinary @types/cloudinary
```

### 4. Test the Migration

1. Start the server and client
2. Upload a test file through the UI
3. Verify the file appears in your Cloudinary dashboard
4. Check that file processing still works correctly
